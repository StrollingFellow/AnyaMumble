# AnyaMumble

This bot is being created to help organize group events on the Bisexual Academy mumble server.
The "main" file is at index.ts and it spiral out from there.

## TODO

### User features

- Finish subscribe/unsubscribe functionality
- Users should be able to tag specific watch groups in post
- Bot should notify people when their group is tagged
  - Could be by @-ing them on the post, could be by personal/group DM, figure out later
- Bot should create/maintain DMs for specific watch groups.
  - needs further discussion, has community splitting potential.
- Easy-to-access user documentation

### Dev Features

- Specify DB file locations in .env
- Dev-side documentation (how to get this project up and running)
